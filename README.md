Developers and Open Source authors now have so many services available, with a wide range of free tiers, discounts and promotions. In addition, many startups now have access to deals from platforms with startup programs such as [Brex](https://brex.com), [Carta](https://carta.com), [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com), [Ramp](https://ramp.com), and [Segment](https://segment.com).

This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings that have **deals for developers**. Ideally, over time, all these deals will be proprietary to this repository with the code ```devdeals```.

The scope of this particular list is limited to things that developers and technical entreprenuers (Full stack developers, startup founders, etc.) would find useful. There are countless numbers of services out there so we will do our best to stay on topic. Of course, this isn't a firm line, so please don't be offended if we reject your contribution.

This repo accepts Pull Requests. You too can help by sending [Pull Requests](https://github.com/devdeals/devdeals) to add more services or by remove ones whose offerings have changed or been retired.

[![Track Awesome List](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/badge.svg)](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/devdeals/devdeals)

*NOTE:* This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to have a comepelling deal (ie, discount, etc) and not just a free trial.
