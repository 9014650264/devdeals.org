# [devdeals.org](https://devdeals.org)

Developers and open source authors now have so many services available, with a range of free tiers, discounts and promotions, and have access to deals from [Brex](https://brex.com), [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com), [Segment](https://segment.com), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-de/corporate-card) and more. However, there is no open source and accessible list of the best deals.

This is a definitive list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, hosting, etc.) with **deals for developers**. All deals should be the best available and, over time, proprietary to this repo with the code ```DEVDEALS```.

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re) 

The scope of this list is limited to things that developers and technical entreprenuers (full stack developers, startup founders, etc.) would find useful. There are a countless numbers of services out there so please don't be offended if we reject your contribution.

This repo accepts [Pull Requests](https://github.com/devdeals/devdeals) so please send them to add more services (or by remove ones whose offerings have changed).

*NOTE:* This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to have a comepelling deal (ie, discount, etc) and not just a free trial.
